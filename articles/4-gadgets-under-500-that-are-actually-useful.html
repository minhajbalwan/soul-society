                So today we are going to show you 10 awesome super useful gadgets that you can buy for under ₹500 and it's insane how many useful gadgets you can get. Now enough talking and let's get started.
            </p>
            
            <!-- 1st -->
            <h3>1. Wipro Smart Bulb - ₹499</h3>

            <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cVzHTzEfL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Wipro Smart Bulb">

            <p>
                This is a <b>Wipro 9W bulb</b> that works with both Alexa and Google Assistant which means you can control it via your phone or via a smart speaker. You can turn it ON or OFF, change its brightness, its color. This bulb is not a rgb bulb but it supports white and warm yellow which is enough for most people. As its 9W bulb is bright enough for most rooms. For <b>₹499</b> it's a great deal for your smart room setup. Price may vary according to the offer.

            <h3>2. Zebronics County Bluetooth Speaker - ₹499</h3>

            <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81v-h4I5CCL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Zebronics County Bluetooth Speaker">

            <p>
                The <b>Zebronics County Portable Bluetooth Speaker</b> has all the features you can think of. So this is the speaker and there's bluetooth mode (obviously), there's a FM mode, AUX mode, micro sd support, usb port, call functionality, 10 hours of playback. It has everything except sound quality. So the sound gets distorted at the max volume and the quality is just missing, but for <b>₹499</b> i am just surprised it turns on.<br />
                Honestly for this price this is not bad especially with all the features it comes with. Price may vary according to the offer.

            <h3>3. Portronics CarPower Mini - ₹299</h3>

            <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Gm0CB5GOS._SL1200_.jpg" alt="Portronics CarPower Mini">

            <p>
                This is actually a regular car charger and it has two charging ports. This dual car charger is actually useful because along with a USB-A port that supports quick charge 3, this also has a USB-C port with 18W power delivery support. I mean with most Iphones and other flagships only giving you a USB-C cable, this makes sense especially with its insane <b>₹299</b> price tag. Price may vary according to the offer.
            </p>

            <h3>4. JBL CSLM20 Lavalier Mic - ₹499</h3>

                So are you a budding instagram reeler or budding instagram influencer and you want a previous video and you bought a dumbass ring light, well i am sorry about that but if your video quality sucks doesn't means that your audio should suck too. Now to help you out here is the jbl mic which is around <b>₹499</b> and it's pretty good. It's an omnidirectional mic with a windshield installed and also has an earphone so that you can monitor your audio in real time. Price may vary according to the offer.
